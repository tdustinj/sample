## Models
This application, api-ospos, has deviated from the Laravel default with respect to namespacing and directory placement of your Eloquent Models.

To create a new model that follows the conventions in place, simply run the make:model command as such:  
`php artisan make:model App\\Models\\MyNewModel`

And that's it!
